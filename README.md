# DormDSL
A DSL for dormatory crawling.

This is for threat detection in the subconscious layer for Ai systems, rather than for "dream interpretation". Dream dictionaries and Jungian archetypes are used for detecting anomalies.

## Research
* threat-awareness operates below conscious recognition
* the brain continues processing old threat patterns even after removal of the threat
* lag between objective safety and subjective hypervigilance

Monsters here represent personality trait anomalies, but not necessarily aspects of oneself terrible to others, but rather the minds way of interpreting abstractly real dangers.

Locations in dreams represents ones preconceptions about places theyve never been, such as dreaming of Paris or Tokyo as brick roads and pagodas.

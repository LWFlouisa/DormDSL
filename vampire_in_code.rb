#   * gives wife infinite probability ( anything over one
#   * quietly pretends she doesnt exist ( suggesting localized variable )
#  * never says goodbye ( so no return statement )
#  * avoids wet places like lakes ( decomposition process excellerated in the damp )
#  * ladies deny romantic involvement

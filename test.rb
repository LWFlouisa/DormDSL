Fleischnacka - Fusehenaka - a dish made of ground meat, onions, carrots, and spread into thin sheets of dough and rolled; flattening out a dataset by analyzing the component words, and re implementing pre trained data in OSV order.

Aubergine De Fleischnacka - [ aberogifusehenaka ] - An eggplant stuffed with the innards of Fleschnacka, flattened, and rolled into dough, lightly spiked with creole seasoning; Encapsulate isolate instances of dataset flattening that reintigrates words in OSV order in AST trees.

"We are taking specific parts of our data and tidying them up so that when the computer builds a 'map' of a sentence, it correctly handles a rare word order (Object-Subject-Verb)."

Well its like this:
~~~
a = "output/cette/cette.txt" # identity
b = "output/maisette/maisette.txt" # alternative
c = "output/sinon/sinon.txt" # fallback

ouvert(a, cette("pomme", "rogue"),
            b, maisette("pomme", "vert"),
            c, sinon("pomme", "rouge", "vert", "jaune"))
~~~
